This is a power BI project based on a survey conducted to know which language, tool are being used mostly all over the world.
Also survey contained some other questions such as how many of the people are happy with their salary or their work please.
Which type of work mode do they prefer in this role. 
This survey was taken my various people's across the globe, with different roles in the data field.

Here some of the basic insights from this project:
1. United States has an average age of working professional in data field is 30.70. According to data on an average 6.39% people believe that they have a good work/life balance in their life and 5.00% people are happy with their salary. And 52.53% survey takers are male and 47.47% are females. 
2. Major working professionals are data scientists.
So based on these insights we can see that only 50% people are happy with their salary and so if we want to increase our productivity we should reconsider their salary structure or provide them some other frindge benefits so that they can work more effectively and happily.
